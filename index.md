## 👋 Hello!

I'm **Vivek Raj**, a final-year PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at IIT, working on:

- Upper-limb **motion intent detection**
- Marker-based **computer vision** & Kalman filtering  
- IMU sensor fusion for orientation  
- ML-driven gesture recognition for assistive robotics  

## 📝 Publications

- Toward Markerless, Noncontact Optical Myography for Prosthetic Control of Multiple Degrees of Freedom, *IEEE SENSORS*, 2024. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10811820](#)
- Feature selection for attention demanding task induced EEG detection, *IEEE APSCON*,[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9276710](#)

## 🔬 Research Summary

I develop algorithms that decode hand and wrist movements in real time to drive rehabilitation robots and prostheses.

## 💬 Blog (Coming Soon)

Weekly, I’ll post illustrated summaries of key papers in computer vision, biomedical signal processing, and human-robot interaction.
